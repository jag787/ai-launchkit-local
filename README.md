## 🌐 Network Access

### Automatic LAN Configuration (Default)

**During installation, the wizard will:**
1. ✅ **Auto-detect your server's LAN IP** (e.g., 192.168.1.100)
2. ✅ **Configure SERVER_IP automatically** in .env
3. ✅ **Set up firewall rules** for LAN access (ports 8000-8099)

**After installation, services are immediately accessible from ANY device:**
```
http://192.168.1.100:8000  # n8n from laptop
http://192.168.1.100:8022  # Flowise from phone
http://192.168.1.100:8003  # Grafana from tablet
http://192.168.1.100:8071  # Email interface from any device
```

**No manual configuration needed!** Just open the URL from any device on your network.

### Localhost Only (Alternative)

If you declined LAN access during installation, services use localhost:
```bash
# Access only from server
http://127.0.0.1:8000  # n8n
http://127.0.0.1:8022  # Flowise  
http://127.0.0.1:8003  # Grafana
```

To enable LAN access later:
1. Find your LAN IP: `ip addr show | grep 'inet ' | grep -v 127.0.0.1`
2. Update .env: `sed -i 's/SERVER_IP=127.0.0.1/SERVER_IP=192.168.1.100/' .env`
3. Restart: `docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.local.yml restart`
4. Add firewall rules: `sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 8000:8099`

### Firewall Status

Check your current firewall configuration:
```bash
# View firewall status
sudo ufw status

# If LAN access wasn't configured during installation, add it manually:
sudo ufw allow from 192.168.0.0/16 to any port 8000:8099
sudo ufw allow from 10.0.0.0/8 to any port 8000:8099
sudo ufw reload
```

2. Trigger an email action
3. Check Mailpit web interface: http://SERVER_IP:8071
4. View email content, headers, attachments

---

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Services Not Starting

**Check port conflicts:**
```bash
netstat -tuln | grep 80
# Look for ports in range 8000-8099
```

**Check Docker resources:**
```bash
docker stats
free -h
df -h
```

**View service logs:**
```bash
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.local.yml logs [service_name]
```

### Network Access Issues

**Can't access from other devices:**
1. Check SERVER_IP in .env matches server's LAN IP
2. Verify firewall allows access:
   ```bash
   sudo ufw status
   sudo ufw allow from 192.168.1.0/24 to any port 8000:8099
   ```
3. Test connectivity: `telnet SERVER_IP 8000`

**Services returning 404/502:**
1. Wait 2-3 minutes for services to fully start
2. Check service is running: `docker ps | grep service_name`
3. Check port binding: `docker port container_name`

### Database Connection Issues

**Services can't connect to PostgreSQL:**
```bash
# Check PostgreSQL is running
docker ps | grep postgres

# Test connection from service
docker exec n8n nc -zv postgres 5432

# Check logs
docker logs postgres
```

### Performance Issues

**High memory usage:**
```bash
# Reduce n8n workers
echo "N8N_WORKER_COUNT=1" >> .env
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.local.yml restart

# Disable resource-heavy services temporarily
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.local.yml stop comfyui langfuse-web
```

**Slow response times:**
- Check available RAM: `free -h`
- Monitor CPU: `htop`
- Add swap: `sudo fallocate -l 4G /swapfile && sudo swapon /swapfile`

### Common Service Issues

<details>
<summary><b>n8n Not Accessible</b></summary>

```bash
# Check n8n container status
docker logs n8n --tail 50

# Check database connection
docker exec n8n nc -zv postgres 5432

# Restart n8n
docker compose -p localai -f docker-compose.local.yml restart n8n
```

**Common causes:**
- Database not ready (wait 2-3 minutes)
- Workflow import still running (check `docker logs n8n-import`)
- Port 8000 already in use

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Flowise Not Loading</b></summary>

```bash
# Check Flowise logs
docker logs flowise --tail 50

# Verify port binding
docker port flowise

## 📈 Performance Optimization

### Resource Requirements by Service Count

**Minimal (n8n + Flowise + Monitoring):**
- RAM: 4GB
- CPU: 2 cores
- Services: ~8 containers

**Standard (+ Business Tools):**
- RAM: 8GB  
- CPU: 4 cores
- Services: ~15 containers

**Full Stack (All Services):**
- RAM: 16GB+
- CPU: 8 cores
- Services: 40+ containers

### Performance Tuning

**Reduce n8n workers:**
```bash
echo "N8N_WORKER_COUNT=1" >> .env
```

**Optimize Baserow:**
```bash
# Already configured in docker-compose:
BASEROW_RUN_MINIMAL=yes
BASEROW_AMOUNT_OF_WORKERS=1
```

**Limit LibreTranslate models:**
```bash
echo "LIBRETRANSLATE_LOAD_ONLY=en,de,fr" >> .env
```

**Disable telemetry:**
Services have telemetry disabled by default for privacy and performance.

## 🔄 Migration from Domain-based Installation

If you have an existing domain-based AI LaunchKit installation:

### Backup Data
```bash
# Export n8n workflows
docker exec n8n n8n export:workflow --backup --output=/backup/workflows.json

# Backup databases
docker exec postgres pg_dumpall -U postgres > backup.sql

# Backup volumes
docker run --rm -v localai_n8n_storage:/data -v $(pwd):/backup alpine \
  tar czf /backup/n8n_backup.tar.gz /data
```

### Migration Steps
1. Deploy this local version on a new server
2. Import workflows via n8n interface
3. Restore database data if needed
4. Update any hardcoded URLs in workflows
5. Test all integrations with new IP:PORT format

```yaml
# In docker-compose.local.yml
services:
  my-service:
    image: my-app:latest
    ports:
      - "8999:3000"  # Use ports outside main range
```

**Custom environment:**
```bash
# In .env
MY_SERVICE_CONFIG=value
MY_API_KEY=secret
